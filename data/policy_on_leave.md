# Company Leave Policy

## Annual Leave
All full-time employees are entitled to 20 days of paid annual leave per year. Leave is accrued on a monthly basis. New employees will have their leave pro-rated for their first year.

## Sick Leave
We offer 10 days of paid sick leave per year. A doctor's note is required for absences longer than 3 consecutive days. Unused sick leave does not roll over to the next year.

## Unpaid Leave
Unpaid leave may be granted on a case-by-case basis for emergencies or personal reasons, subject to manager approval.
